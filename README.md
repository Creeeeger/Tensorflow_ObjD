### Tensorflow_ObjD

## Tensorflow object detection software in java 

- SQL backend for saving amount of detected objects

- XML backend for faster restoring the old configuration 

- Detect what is on images

- Train / Create your own models

- Prepare images for CoreMl training

- Generate images with stable diffusion

- Generate images with SD4J

- Create checkpoints from training datasets

- Training data analysis for loss function

- (Later) Tensorflow development dependant -- hardware acceleration usage (npu) & detect images with checkpoints made

- Based on tensorflow 2.x for unix systems (Tested on macOS 14 M1 Pro)
